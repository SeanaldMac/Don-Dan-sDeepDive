# Team game that spanned three weeks

For this project, I was the programmer and helped create a 2D arcade side scroller that was played on the department's arcade machine. This game is 2 player co-op where the player that scores the ,ost points by collecting treasure chests win. However, players must dodge the enemies swimming at them while also collecting oxygen tanks before their oxygen meter runs out.

The main components I programmed were the health system, enemy wave spawn, player controls, and a score system. The health system consists of a health bar for each player that constantly drains over time. It replenishes when the respective player collects an oxygen tank and depletes by a chunk when the player is hit by an enemy. The enemy wave was made by randomly choosing a number of enemies from an enemy array and then spawning them after varying periods of time. The player controls consisted of horizontal joystick movement, a button for the player to float, and a way to fire projectles. Also, the player will automatically sink if the float button is not held. Finally, I mad ea simple score system where each player has their own score and whoever has the highest after both die wins (includes ties).
